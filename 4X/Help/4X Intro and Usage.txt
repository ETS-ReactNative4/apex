Apex 4X Intro and Usage Instructions

Intro

4X is a combination of two APIs that are specifically designed to enhance and fasilitate advanced ARIA development.

The $A API provides all core functionality, including dynamic modularization for swappable components, advanced ARIA development features and processes, data management, DOM related methods and processes, dynamic import methods, visual effect methods for content display and animation, and chaining.

The DC (Dynamic Component) API provides  direct access to individually configurable components and widgets. Each DC instance includes the ability to control dynamic behaviors, manage content and events, utilize lifecycle methods, pass custom props between other DC instances and external resources, control rendering processes, plus manage visual effects and animation.

Usage

1. Place the 4X folder at the root of your website directory. The 4X folder should then be accessible from "www.YourDomain.com/4X".

2. Add the following script statement within the head of your page.

<script type="text/javascript" src="/4X/4X.js"></script>

When loaded, all features of the $A API are available.

In contrast, the DC API is only applicable when creating DC instances for the configuring of dynamic components. For help regarding this, view the documentation at: 
"4X/Help/$A API/DC Objects/", and 
"4X/Help/DC API/DC Object Configuration".
